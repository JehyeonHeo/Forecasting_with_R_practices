1. Consider monthly sales and advertising data for an automotive parts company (data set advert).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question1}

# a. Plot the data using autoplot. Why is it useful to set facets=TRUE?
str(advert)
head(advert)

autoplot(advert, facets = TRUE)
# Can see the advertising expenditure data and sales volume data in different panels. facets = TRUE option can plot the subsets of data in each panel.

# b. Fit a standard regression model yt = a + b*xt + nt where yt denotes sales and xt denotes advertising using the tslm() function.
advert_tslm <- tslm(sales ~ advert, data = advert)

# c. Show that the residuals have significant autocorrelation.
checkresiduals(advert_tslm)
# The residuals have significant autocorrelations at lag 1 and 2.

# d. What difference does it make you use the function instead:
#  Arima(advert[,"sales"], xreg=advert[,"advert"], order=c(0,0,0))
advert_dreg.0.0.0 <- Arima(
  advert[, "sales"], xreg = advert[, "advert"],
  order = c(0, 0, 0)
)

checkresiduals(advert_dreg.0.0.0)
advert_tslm$residuals - advert_dreg.0.0.0$residuals
# The residuals from dynamic regression model are almost same as the residuals from tslm function.
# But when I use Arima function, I can do ARIMA modeling for residuals by designating order.

# e. Refit the model using auto.arima(). How much difference does the error model make to the estimated parameters? What ARIMA model for the errors is selected?
advert_dreg.auto <- auto.arima(
  advert[, "sales"], xreg = advert[, "advert"]

# intercept : 78.7343, slope_advert : 0.5343

advert_dreg.auto
# error model : ARIMA(0, 1, 0)
# xreg : 0.5063

# f. Check the residuals of the fitted model.
checkresiduals(advert_dreg.auto)
# The residuals are like white noise.

accuracy(advert_dreg.0.0.0)
accuracy(advert_dreg.auto)
# The plot above and most of errors show that dynamic regression with ARIMA(0, 1, 0) error model was better than the linear regression model.

# g. Assuming the advertising budget for the next six months is exactly 10 units per month, produce and plot sales forecasts with prediction intervals for the next six months.
fc_advert_dreg.auto <- forecast(

2. This exercise uses data set huron giving the level of Lake Huron from 1875-1972.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question2}

# a. Fit a piecewise linear trend model to the Lake Huron data with a knot at 1920 and an ARMA error structure.
autoplot(huron)

t <- time(huron)
t.knot <- 1920
# make t.pw variable which is a vector in which contains piecewise times. Values in t.pw are 0 for all years before knot year(1920). But the values increase as year increases after the knot year.

# b. Forecast the level for the next 30 years.
h <- 30
t.new <- t[length(t)] + seq(h)
t.pw.new <- t.pw[length(t.pw)] + seq(h)
newdata <- cbind(t = t.new, t.pw = t.pw.new)

# The level of lake Huron was forecasted to increase slowly after 1973.

checkresiduals(fc_huron_dreg.auto)
# The residuals are like white noise.

```


3. This exercise concerns motel: the total monthly takings from accommodation and the total room nights occupied at hotels, motels, and guest houses in Victoria, Australia, between January 1980 and June 1995. Total monthly takings are in thousands of Australian dollars; total room nights occupied are in thousands.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question3}

autoplot(avg.cost_night.room)
# Average cost of a night's accomodation in Victoria increased fastly until 1990, and then just oscillated without increasing until 1995.

# b. Estimate the monthly CPI.
# I'll use ARIMA model to estimate monthly CPI.
# I'll use log transformation before fitting the model using lambda = 0 option.
CPI_autoarima <- auto.arima(
  motel[, "CPI"], lambda = 0
)

autoplot(motel[, "CPI"]) +
  autolayer(CPI_autoarima$fitted)

# c. Produce time series plots of both variables and explain why logarithms of both variables need to be taken before fitting any models.
autoplot(avg.cost_night.room)
autoplot(CPI_autoarima$fitted)
# logarithms can make the variations almost same for all the time. It can also make slowly increasing data linearly. Therefore it would be better for the above 2 variables to take logarithms before fitting any model.

# d. Fit an appropriate regression model with ARIMA errors. Explain your reasoning in arriving at the final model.
# fit avg.cost_night.room using linear regression model after log transformation. I will use fitted values of CPI_autoarima as a regressor.

# as I said in part c, it would be better to use logarithm transformation before fitting the model.

  avg.cost_night.room, xreg = CPI_autoarima$fitted,
  lambda = 0, stepwise = FALSE, approximation = FALSE
)

checkresiduals(avg.cost_night.room_dreg.auto)
# The residuals are like white noise.

# The unit of average cost is thousand of AU$. Therefore make a function to transform average cost value to have AU$ unit. I'm going to use the function in plot labeling.
formatter1000 <- function(x){ 
  scales::dollar(x*1000)
}

  scale_y_continuous(labels = formatter1000)
# dynamic regression model after log transformation fits better than the linear regression model.

# e. Forecast the average price per room for the next twelve months using your fitted model. (Hint: You will need to produce forecasts of the CPI figures first.)
fc_CPI_autoarima <- forecast(
  CPI_autoarima, h = 12
)

fc_avg.cost_night.room_dreg.auto <- forecast(

# It is forecasted that the average cost of a night's accomodation in Victoria, Australia will be increased a little with oscillation.

4. We fitted a harmonic regression model to part of the gasoline series in Exercise 6 in Section 5.10. We will now revisit this model, and extend it to include more data and ARMA errors.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question4}
