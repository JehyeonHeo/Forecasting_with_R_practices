1. Use the help menu to explore what the series gold, woolyrnq and gas represent. These are available in the forecast package.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question1}

# See the structures of datas
str(gold)
str(woolyrnq)
str(gas)

# a. Use autoplot to plot each of these in separate plots.
autoplot(gold)
autoplot(woolyrnq)
autoplot(gas)
writeLines("")

# b. What is the frequency of each commodity series? Hint: apply the frequency() function.
print("Frequency")
print("gold")
frequency(gold)
print("woolyrnq")
frequency(woolyrnq)
print("gas")
frequency(gas)
writeLines("")

# c. Use which.max() to spot the outlier in the gold series. Which observation was it?
print("When gold got maximum value?")
which.max(gold)
print("What was the gold's maximum value?")
gold[which.max(gold)]
```


2. Download the file tute1.csv from OTexts.org/fpp2/extrafiles/tute1.csv, open it in Excel (or some other spreadsheet application), and review its contents. You should find four columns of information. Columns B through D each contain a quarterly series, labelled Sales, AdBudget and GDP. Sales contains the quarterly sales for a small company over the period 1981-2005. AdBudget is the advertising budget and GDP is the gross domestic product. All series have been adjusted for inflation.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question2}

# a. You can read the data into R with the following script:

tute1 <- read.csv("tute1.csv", header=TRUE)
View(tute1)

# b. Convert the data to time series

mytimeseries <- ts(tute1[,-1], start=1981, frequency=4)

# (The [,-1] removes the first column which contains the quarters as we don't need them now.)

# c. Construct time series plots of each of the three series

autoplot(mytimeseries, facets=TRUE)

# Check what happens when you don't include facets=TRUE.

autoplot(mytimeseries)

```


3. Download some monthly Australian retail data from OTexts.org/fpp2/extrafiles/retail.xlsx. These represent retail sales in various categories for different Australian states, and are stored in a MS-Excel file.

 a. You can read the data into R with the following script:

retaildata <- readxl::read_excel("retail.xlsx", skip=1)
You may need to first install the readxl package. The second argument (skip=1) is required because the Excel sheet has two header rows.

 b. Select one of the time series as follows (but replace the column name with your own chosen column):

myts <- ts(retaildata[,"A3349873A"], frequency=12, start=c(1982,4))

 c. Explore your chosen retail time series using the following functions:

autoplot, ggseasonplot, ggsubseriesplot, gglagplot, ggAcf

Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend? What do you learn about the series?

4. Create time plots of the following times series: bicoal, chicken, dole, usdeaths, lynx, goog, writing, fancy, a10, h02.

 - Use help() to find out about the data in each series.
 - For the goog plot, modify the axis labels and title.

5. Use the ggseasonplot and ggsubseriesplot functions to explore the seasonal patterns in the following time series: writing, fancy, a10, h02.

 - What can you say about the seasonal patterns?
 - Can you identify any unusual years?

6. Use the the following graphics functions: autoplot, ggseasonplot, ggsubseriesplot, gglagplot, ggAcf and explore features from the following time series: hsales, usdeaths, bricksq, sunspotarea, gasoline.
 - Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend?
 - What do you learn about the series?

7. The arrivals data set comprises quarterly international arrivals (in thousands) to Australia from Japan, New Zealand, UK and the US.
 - Use autoplot, ggseasonplot and ggsubseriesplot to compare the differences between the arrivals from these four countries.
 - Can you identify any unusual observations?

9. The pigs data shows the monthly total number of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia, from Jan 1980 to Aug 1995. Use mypigs <- window(pigs, start=1990) to select the data starting from 1990. Use autoplot and ggAcf for mypigs series and compare these to white noise plots from Figures 2.15 and 2.16.

10. dj contains 292 consecutive trading days of the Dow Jones Index. Use ddj <- diff(dj) to compute the daily changes in the index. Plot ddj and its ACF. Do the changes in the Dow Jones Index look like white noise?
