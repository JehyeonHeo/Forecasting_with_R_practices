2. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock price series (data set ibmclose). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows that the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question1}

ggtsdisplay(ibmclose)
# ACF plot shows that the autocorrelation values are bigger than critical value and decrease slowly. Also, r1 is large(near to 1) and positive. It means that the IBM stock data are non-stationary(predictable using lagged values).
# PACF plot shows that there is a strong correlation between IBM stock data and their 1 lagged values. It means that IBM stock data can be predicted by 1 lagged values and they aren't stationary.

# To get stationary data, IBM stock data need differencing. Differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series. Therefore it will eliminate or reduce trend and seasonality and the effect can make non-staionary data stationary.

```


3. For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation and order of differencing in order to obtain stationary data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question3}

# a. usnetelec
autoplot(usnetelec)
# It is almost linearly increasing data. It looked like that the data only need first differencing.
Box.test(diff(usnetelec), type = "Ljung-Box")
# first differenced usnetelec data can be thought of as a white noise series.
kpss.test(diff(usnetelec))
# kpss test result also shows that first differencing made the data stationary.

# b. usgdp
autoplot(usgdp)
# It is almost linearly increasing data. It looked like that the data only need first differencing.
Box.test(diff(usgdp), type = "Ljung-Box")
# first differenced usnetelec data cannot be thought of as a white noise series.
autoplot(diff(usgdp))
# There is still a trend left in the differenced data. It looked like one more differencing would be enough, but use ndiffs function to check the number of differencing needed.
ndiffs(usgdp)
# One more differencing would be enough.
autoplot(diff(diff(usgdp)))
# Plot shows that the twice differenced data is like white noise series.
Box.test(diff(diff(usgdp)), type = "Ljung-Box")
# But it couldn't pass Ljung-Box test.
ggAcf(diff(diff(usgdp)))
# There are still some autocorrelations left.
kpss.test(diff(diff(usnetelec)))
# But kpss test result shows that differencing twice was enough to make the data stationary. Therefore in usgdp data case, even if twice differencing didn't make the data like white noise series, it made the data stationary.

# c. mcopper
autoplot(mcopper)
# mcopper data have increasing trend. And they have bigger variation for bigger prices. Therefore I'll use Box-Cox transformation before differencing.
autoplot(diff(BoxCox(mcopper, BoxCox.lambda(mcopper))))
Box.test(diff(BoxCox(mcopper, BoxCox.lambda(mcopper))),
         type = "Ljung-Box")

ggAcf(diff(BoxCox(mcopper, BoxCox.lambda(mcopper))))
# There are still some autocorrelations left.
kpss.test(diff(BoxCox(mcopper, BoxCox.lambda(mcopper))))
# But kpss test result shows that differencing with Box-Cox transformation was enough to make the data stationary. In mcopper data case, even if differencing with Box-Cox transformation didn't make the data like white noise series, it made the data stationary.

# d. enplanements
autoplot(enplanements)

)
# But kpss test result shows that differencings with Box-Cox transformation was enough to make the data stationary. In enplanements data case, even if differencings with Box-Cox transformation didn't make the data like white noise series, it made the data stationary.

# e. visitors
autoplot(visitors)
# visitors data are similar to enplanements data. They have seasonality and increasing trend. It looked like they also need Box-Cox transformation, first and seasonal differencing.
ndiffs(visitors)
nsdiffs(visitors)
# visitors data need 1 first and 1 seasonal differencing.
autoplot(
  diff(
    diff(
      BoxCox(visitors, BoxCox.lambda(visitors)),
      lag = 12
    )
  )
)
Box.test(

```


4. For the enplanements data, write down the differences you chose above using backshift operator notation.

### the data needed 1 first difference, 1 seasonal difference after Box-Cox transformation. The model of the data can be written as ARIMA(0, 1, 0)(0, 1, 0)12 with Box-Cox transformation(lambda = -0.227).
### The model expression using backshift operator notaion B: 
### first equation : wt = (yt^(-0.227) - 1)/(-0.227)
### second equation : (1 - B)(1 - B^12)wt = et, where et is a white noise series.


5. For your retail data (from Exercise 3 in Section 2.10), find the appropriate order of differencing (after transformation if necessary) to obtain stationary data.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Question5}

                    sheetIndex = 1)

retail.ts <- ts(retail[,"A3349873A"], 
                frequency=12, 
                start=c(1982,4))

autoplot(retail.ts)
# the data have increasing trend and strong seasonality. And there are bigger variations for bigger numbers. Therefore I think that I need to use first differencing and seasonal differencing. And it would be better to do Box-Cox transformation.
ndiffs(retail.ts)
nsdiffs(retail.ts)
# I'm going to do 1 first differencing and 1 seasonal differencing.
kpss.test(
  diff(
    diff(
      BoxCox(retail.ts, BoxCox.lambda(retail.ts)),
      lag = 12
    )
  )
)
# To make retail.ts data stationary, I did Box-Cox transformation, 1 first differencing and 1 seasonal differencing.

# b. What can you learn from the ACF graph?
ggAcf(austourists)
# autocorrelations are slowly decreasing. And the values at the lags of multiple of 4 were big compared to the others.

# c. What can you learn from the PACF graph?
ggPacf(austourists)
# there are 5 significant spikes, and then no significant spikes thereafter (apart from one at lag 8, which are probably related with quarterly seasonality).

# d. Produce plots of the seasonally differenced data  (1 ??? B^4)Yt. What model do these graphs suggest?
ggtsdisplay(diff(austourists, lag = 4))
# the seasonally differenced data are looked like to need at least one more differencing to make it stationary.

# Disregarding the values at lag 4, autocorrelation values are looked like decreasing sinusoidally while partial autocorrelation values have spikes at lag 1 and 5.

11. Consider the total net generation of electricity (in billion kilowatt hours) by the U.S. electric industry (monthly for the period January 1973 - June 2013). (Data set usmelec.) In general there are two peaks per year: in mid-summer and mid-winter.

14. For the same time series you used in the previous exercise, try using a non-seasonal model applied to the seasonally adjusted data obtained from STL. The stlf() function will make the calculations easy (with method="arima"). Compare the forecasts with those obtained in the previous exercise. Which do you think is the best approach?


15. For your retail time series (Exercise 5 above):

a. develop an appropriate seasonal ARIMA model;

16. 
a. Produce a time plot of the sheep population of England and Wales from 1867-1939 (data set sheep).
b. Assume you decide to fit the following model:
yt = yt-1 + phi1(yt-1 - yt-2) + phi2(yt-2 - yt-3) + phi3(yt-3 - yt-4) + et
